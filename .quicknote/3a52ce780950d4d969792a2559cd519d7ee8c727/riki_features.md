# Planned Featuresu

- TODO don't save a local copy of config file, just in ~/.config/riki/config
- select a wiki when adding, deleting or viewing notes
- view subdirectories and notes from the top down of selected wiki
  - choosing a subdirectory should open that subdirectory and then display its content
- function to populate the wiki's index page and all subdirectory index pages with markdown links to the other contents of that level of the wiki in a list at the file's end.
